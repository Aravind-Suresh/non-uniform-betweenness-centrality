# Non uniform betweenness centrality
Implementation of non-uniform betweenness centrality given non-uniform weights for vertex pairs ( prior ) for a simple graph ( directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted ).

## Trial
To compile,
```
$ make
```
To run, execute
```
$ ./bin/main
```
and provide input in the appropriate format ( refer tests/\*.txt ).

For a sample run,
```
$ ./bin/main < tests/1.txt
```
